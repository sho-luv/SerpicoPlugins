# Overview

This plug-in adds a NIST800-30 chart button to the edit and add finding webpages. This allows the user to have a visual reference when setting the NIST800-30 values of Impact and Likelihood. The user can see what the risk rating will be without having to save the finding to know.


# Command Line

The plugin can be run from the command line in the Serpico directory. It will not run in a different directory as it is path dependent.

```
ruby plugins/NIST800_Chart/nist800_plugin.rb
```
