# Overview

This plug-in adds CIS Top 20 Controls to the findings database. This will allow each finding to have CIS control assigned to it by adding a cis_control variable to each finding in the database. Since there are 20 CIS controls they will be presented as a drop down menu option when editing or adding findings.

# Command Line

The plugin can be run from the command line in the Serpico directory.

```
cd plugins/CIS_Control
```
